=============================

http://research.microsoft.com/zootracer

Prerequisites
-------------

- 64-bit PC with 64-bit Windows OS. 4GB RAM recommended as a minimum. The
  larger video files you process the more RAM you need. 4 CPU cores
  recommended although the more cores you have the more interactive the tool.
- Microsoft .NET Framework v.4.5 or later. The framework is available for
  download from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653.
- Visual C++ 2013 redistributable packages available for download from
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784

Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. A link to zootracer.zip can be found on the tool home page
   http://research.microsoft.com/zootracer. Download the archive and unpack it
   to any folder on your hard disk.
2. Download OpenCV v.2.4.13 from http://opencv.org/downloads.html and unpack
   the archive. Copy the following folders from 'opencv\build' to 'OpenCV2' folder:
      include
      x64
      x86

Getting started
---------------

Zootracer implements an interactive algorithm from the paper A. M. Buchanan
and A. W. Fitzgibbon, "Interactive Feature Tracking using K-D Trees and
Dynamic Programming", in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer
Vision and Pattern Recognition, New York, January 2006.

Start zootrace.exe, open a video and switch to 'interactive trace' tab.
The tool first runs two-phase preprocessing routine. During the first phase
the colour indicator along the left edge of the screen is red. You can
navigate the video but interactive trace controls do nothing at this stage.
First stage usually takes several minutes depending on your CPU speed.

During the second stage the color indicator progresses from blue to gray.
You may start building a trace during this stage.

Zootrcer stores the results of pre-processing in a subfolder next to the
video file and reuses the results next time you start the tool. Pre-pro-
cessing may restart when you change some of zootracer parameters on the
'settings' page.

You may save/restore a trace with all the parameters in a csv file using appropri-
ate buttons on 'file' page.
